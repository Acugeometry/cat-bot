# Setup
Good luck on that.
1. Create a `db.json` file. Here is a template of an empty db:

   `{"cat": {}, "summon_ids": []}`
   
   Put that there if you are just starting out.

2. Go inside of the `main.py` file, on first few lines you can change some config values, such as owner id, guild id, and bot id. You will need to create a guild and upload all emojis to a guild. You can download all the emojis here: <pending>
3. Done!
