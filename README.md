# Setup
Good luck on that.
1. Create a `db.json` file. Here is a template of an empty db:

   `{"cat": {}, "summon_ids": []}`
   
   Put that there if you are just starting out.
   
   Calion made a nice file explaining all the db values [here](https://calion.repl.co/static/catbot/db.txt)

2. Go inside of the `main.py` file, on first few lines you can change some config values, such as owner ID, guild ID, and bot ID. You will need to create a guild and upload all emojis to that guild. You can download all the emojis here: `<pending>`
3. Done!
